# STF-RNN
Keras implementation of STF-RNN: Space Time Features-based Recurrent Neural Network for Predicting People Next Location 

## Requirements 

## How to run?
First, downlaod the data using the follwoing command:
```bash
 wget https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/4/8/F4894AA5-FDBC-481E-9285-D5F8C4C4F039/Geolife%20Trajectories%201.3.zip
 ```
and Extract the directory "Data" to the location of "STF-RNN.py".

Then, execute the following command:

```bash
python STF-RNN.py -e1 100 -e2 6 -r 20
```
